# AGENTS.md

> Generated by `scripts/manageAgents.js` (auto rule for src). Edit `agents.config.json` to update this file.

## Module defaults for ui

**Scope:** Files under src/ui inherit these defaults unless a deeper AGENTS.md overrides them.

### Instructions

1. Adhere to the repository-wide quality gates defined in the root AGENTS.md.
2. Document any new platform interactions introduced within src/ui and ensure they remain cross-platform safe.
3. Add focused Jest coverage under src/ui/**tests**/ for each new code path.
4. Prefer composable utilities and dependency injection so that the ui module remains testable.

### Notes

- Generated automatically from agents.config.json. Update the template rather than editing this file directly.
