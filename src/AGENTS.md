## Source code conventions

**Scope:** All TypeScript source files unless a nested AGENTS.md adds more specific instructions.

### Instructions

1. Write strongly typed modules with explicit interfaces and avoid using `any`; add shared types under `src/session/models.ts` or a dedicated types module when necessary.
2. Log recoverable errors with contextual information and ensure fatal paths bubble up exceptions for higher-level handling.
3. Co-locate unit tests under `__tests__` directories and keep them deterministic; mock native modules when interacting with platform APIs.
4. Prefer dependency-injected helpers over singletons to maintain testability and modular design.
5. Update telemetry or analytics integrations consistently across platforms when introducing new capture or diagnostics features.

### Notes

- Runtime feature flags should be centralized to maintain predictable behavior across mobile platforms.
- Use `Platform.select` or similar utilities for platform branching instead of littering checks throughout business logic.
