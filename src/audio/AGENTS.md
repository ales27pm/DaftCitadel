## Audio engine module guidance

**Scope:** The audio engine abstractions and related utilities housed in src/audio/.

### Instructions

1. Keep the TypeScript interfaces synchronized with the native bridge definitions in `NativeAudioEngine.ts`; validate payload shapes with runtime guards where feasible.
2. Ensure automation routines remain idempotent and avoid blocking operations on the JS thread when driving native audio components.
3. Add high-signal Jest coverage for scheduling, buffer management, and error handling paths inside `src/audio/__tests__/`.
4. Document timing-sensitive assumptions directly in code comments and surface debug logging hooks for troubleshooting audio drift.
5. Coordinate changes with session management so that audio state transitions remain atomic across reconnects or failures.

### Notes

- When adding new native capabilities, capture the Objective-C/Swift or Kotlin implementation details in docs/ with entitlement requirements.
- Prefer pure functions or lightweight classes for orchestration logic to simplify deterministic testing.
