# AGENTS.md
> Generated by `scripts/manageAgents.js` (manual entry (.)). Edit `agents.config.json` to update this file.

## Repository-wide automation and contribution guidelines

**Scope:** All files in the repository unless a more specific AGENTS.md overrides these rules.

### Instructions
1. Follow strict TypeScript and React Native patterns; keep platform-specific code guarded behind runtime checks and prefer shared abstractions when possible.
2. Before committing, run `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, `npm run typecheck`, and `npm run prettier` to keep the project production-ready.
3. Preserve cross-platform support for iOS and Android, relying only on public APIs and approved tooling for network diagnostics research.
4. Document user-facing behavior and developer workflows in the `docs/` directory when introducing notable changes.
5. Run `npm run manage:agents` at the end of each session so that generated AGENTS.md files stay synchronized with `agents.config.json`.
6. Production code must be complete and fully functional; placeholders and stubs are not allowed. Test mocks and test doubles are acceptable when they enable deterministic unit testing.

### Notes
- This file is maintained automatically by `scripts/manageAgents.js`; edit `agents.config.json` instead of modifying AGENTS.md manually.
- Nested AGENTS.md files may extend these rules but must not weaken repository-wide quality or security guarantees.
