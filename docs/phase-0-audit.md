# Phase 0 Audit

## Tooling and Quality Baseline

- Installed npm dependencies (`npm install`) to ensure crypto primitives such as `tweetnacl` are available at runtime.
- Added a typed stub for `tweetnacl` under [`src/types/stubs/tweetnacl.d.ts`](../src/types/stubs/tweetnacl.d.ts) so the Jest and TypeScript pipelines compile without ambient `any` escapes.
- Verified the repository scripts: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test`, and `npm run prettier` all complete successfully after the dependency refresh.
- Existing automation (`npm run manage:agents`) remains unchanged and should still be executed at the end of every development session to regenerate nested contribution guides.

## Module Inventory

### Audio Engine (`src/audio`, `audio-engine/`)

- JavaScript bridge [`AudioEngine`](../src/audio/AudioEngine.ts) initializes the native module, configures nodes, and forwards automation envelopes through [`ClockSyncService`](../src/audio/Automation.ts).
- Native C++ core under [`audio-engine/`](../audio-engine) already exposes scene graph, scheduler, and platform bridges, but no React Native TurboModule implementation is committed; `NativeAudioEngine.ts` assumes a module named `AudioEngineModule` exists.
- Missing pieces for playback include track-to-node routing, buffer streaming from session clips, transport control, and diagnostics propagation from the native layer back to JS.

### Session Management (`src/session`)

- [`SessionManager`](../src/session/sessionManager.ts) coordinates persistence, optimistic history, cloud sync hooks, and expects an injected `AudioEngineBridge` to mirror session updates into the renderer.
- Storage adapters exist for JSON and SQLite (`src/session/storage`), but they only persist serialized sessions; there is no glue code wiring them into UI flows or background sync routines yet.
- Conflict resolution primitives (`mergeSessions`, history stack) are in place but untested against real engine feedback loops because the audio bridge is still a stub.

### Collaboration and Diagnostics (`src/services/collab`)

- [`CollabSessionService`](../src/services/collab/CollabSessionService.ts) orchestrates WebRTC data channels, encryption via [`EncryptionManager`](../src/services/collab/encryption.ts), and adaptive bitrate/latency tuning.
- Diagnostics hooks (`NetworkDiagnostics`, `DiagnosticsManager`) exist but only log to injected callbacks; there is no UI exposure or persistent telemetry sink.
- Signaling client abstractions expect an external implementation, and there is no integration that feeds collaborative edits into `SessionManager`.

### UI Shell (`src/ui`)

- Arrangement and mixer screens (`src/ui/screens`) render demo data only: `ArrangementScreen` builds synthesized waveforms and piano-roll notes in-memory, while `MixerScreen` animates random meters via Reanimated.
- Navigation scaffolding and design system primitives (`NeonSurface`, `NeonToolbar`, etc.) are present, yet no data binding or state management connects the UI to sessions, audio transport, or collaboration events.
- Automation editors (`src/ui/editors`) currently visualize static inputs and lack gestures to edit real session curves.

## Gap Analysis by Phase

### Phase 1 – Core Audio Engine MVP

- Implement the missing TurboModule bridges so `AudioEngineModule` can be initialized on both iOS and Android, exposing track playback, transport control, and render diagnostics back to TypeScript.
- Extend `AudioEngine` with track graph orchestration that maps `Session` tracks/clips into native nodes, scheduling buffer playback, gain automation, and tempo alignment.
- Connect `SessionManager` to the UI and persistence flows so creating/loading sessions updates storage adapters and primes the audio engine; add regression tests covering end-to-end load/save cycles.

### Phase 2 – Primary UI Views

- Replace demo content in `ArrangementScreen`/`MixerScreen` with live data sourced from `SessionManager`, reflecting clip placements, automation curves, and mixer levels.
- Flesh out the design system to support arrangement timeline rulers, track headers, mixer channel strips, and automation lane editors with proper gesture handling across platforms.
- Add navigation state and view models that react to playback status, selection, and undo/redo history while keeping tests deterministic.

### Phase 3 – Plugin Hosting & Routing

- Deliver the native `PluginHostModule` that backs the existing `PluginHost` TypeScript facade, including sandbox provisioning, preset management, crash recovery, and automation scheduling.
- Build effect rack and routing UI components that manipulate the routing graph defined in [`src/session/models.ts`](../src/session/models.ts), ensuring changes propagate to the audio engine without blocking the render thread.
- Expand Jest coverage around plugin lifecycle, crash telemetry, and routing graph mutations once native bridges are in place.

### Phase 4 – Collaboration, Diagnostics, Deployment

- Integrate `CollabSessionService` with real signaling backends, persistence conflict resolution, and session diff/merge logic so collaborative edits are reflected in the audio engine and UI.
- Surface diagnostics (latency metrics, packet loss, render xruns) inside dedicated performance tooling views and feed structured logs into mobile-friendly logging frameworks (e.g., `os.log`, Android Logcat).
- Finalize deployment workflows: document Xcode/AltStore sideloading steps, define entitlements (NetworkExtension, Wi-Fi info), and automate release packaging with CI scripts.

## Recommendations

- Maintain the freshly added `tweetnacl` type definitions to keep strict type safety during future crypto work; coordinate upgrades if upstream packages publish first-party typings.
- Establish CI pipelines that run the verified lint/test/typecheck/prettier suite to enforce the current green baseline before Phase 1 development begins.
- Document native build steps (CMake, Android/iOS bridging) alongside RN integration once TurboModules are implemented to avoid regressions in subsequent phases.
