## Documentation authoring guidelines

**Scope:** Content within docs/ that explains architecture, runbooks, or operational procedures.

### Instructions
1. Keep documentation actionable and up to date with the implementation; update relevant sections when behavior changes.
2. Prefer Markdown with clear headings, ordered lists for procedures, and link to source modules using relative paths when providing references.
3. Include platform-specific caveats (iOS, Android, desktop tooling) where applicable to network diagnostics features.
4. Validate code snippets before publishing and annotate prerequisites such as required CLI tools or entitlements.

### Notes
- Architectural diagrams or binary assets should live under docs/assets/ with descriptive filenames if needed.
- Cross-link documentation sections to avoid duplication whenever multiple files describe the same subsystem.
